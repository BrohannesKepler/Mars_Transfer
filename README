Earth to Mars direct transfer trajectory solver.

This script requests a departure and arrival date from the user, as well as a 
desired arrival parking orbit altitude, and computes the transfer trajectory 
to Mars, using a solution to Lambert's problem, as well as Battin's method to 
determine the shape of the departure hyperbola. The arrival hyperbola is also 
shaped in order to view the trajectory.

The deltaV's required at departure injection as well as arrival orbit insertion 
are computed, as well as the required C3 [km^2/s^2]. Impulsive burns are assumed, as well as a direct transfer to Mars.
